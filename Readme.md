# Delta-Simulink
Delta-Simulink [[1]] is an extension for simulink to model variability using 
delta modelling.<br/>
A description of Delta-Simulink as well as an overview of its architecture can 
be found at [[1]]. If you are interested in the topic of software varibility you
can find an overview of our scientific work on that topic at [[2]].
